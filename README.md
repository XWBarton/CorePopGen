# CorePopGen
 Custom, simple, standalone scripts for processing population genetics data and performing analysis.

 The aim for these scripts are to be:

**Streamlined**: Light code that can run on most machines.  
**Standalone**: Scripts can be used independently of each other.  
**Simple**: Basic command line I/O.  
**Standardised**: Doesn't use proprietary or overly complicated data formats for I/O.
